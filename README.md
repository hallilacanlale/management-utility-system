management utility to track diagnostic test sampling and distribution between a laboratory and many testing sites


A management utility to track diagnostic tests and their results. A diagnostic test can be taken at a testing site, which is part of a lab. It requires a sample being taken from a patient (e.g., a nose swab), and can detect the presence of a pathogen (i.e., positive), detect the absence of a pathogen (i.e., negative), or return an invalid result. Once samples are taken, they need to be stored at a controlled temperature. The capacity for testing sites to store such samples is limited. For efficiency reasons, samples may be moved between testing sites. Once a test has a result, its sample is destroyed.
